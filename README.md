# Manage your research project

This is a workshop in development about how to set up a research project on your computer.
There are many ways to do this, and how you do it may depend on your unique project and 
personal preferences. This workshop will guide you through an example of how you can
organize your research project files, use version control, create a Python module to
contain useful functions, and prepare a paper and reproduction package at the end.

Nothing that we show here is compulsory. Just follow along and see which tips and tricks 
you can use for your own research project.
